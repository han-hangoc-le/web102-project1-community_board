# Web Development Project 1 - *Community Board*

Submitted by: **Han Le**

This web app: **This website is a introduction board to exploring Danang City, Vietnam! All the places and food recommendation are from me - a Danang local. On each card, there are Vietnamese names, English names and a button to learn more about the item. I created 3 categories: local food, local attractions and local nature. Judging by the number of items in each category, you probably know which aspect of Danang I love the most ;)**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Notes

At first, I got very confused with modifying the website's body div to fit the whole screen. In the end I somehow work it out and it works well! Besides that, I also had to spend a lot of time searching on CSS to style elements as I am not that familiar with CSS yet. That's probably the reason why I spent so long on this project.
